# Project Summary
We are real estate investors interested in investing in Miami, Tampa, or Orlando. We are looking at purchasing properties traditionally or through liens.We would then turn those properties into Airbnb's or traditional rentals, and compare and contrast the profit that can be made from those properties. The document contains data pulled from goverment and real estate websites. Refer to powerpoint "Invest Smartly with R.E.T" to see visually.


## Project Premise
R.E.T Real Estate Consultants
“The Best Investment on Earth is Earth”

Our mission is to educate our clients how to purchase real estate the correct way, then turn their purchase into a profit.  Our method is a two-step process of comparisons.

### Step One: Property Acquisition
In this business there is a popular saying, “In real estate, money is made when you buy, not when you sell”.  This quote expresses the importance of the buy transaction, as this is the beginning of the investment process. The basics of investing is to buy at the lowest available price point, then sell at the opposite end. We teach our clients how to purchase using two methods: tax liens or traditional purchases. Our proprietary data compares the two buy options and informs us which is the better option for our client.

### Step Two: Pick Your Pay
After the purchase is complete, it is now time to turn a profit. This is by far the most gratifying part of the process. Like the acquisition process, step two is equipped with a few options as well. At R.E.T we teach our clients how to rent their newly acquired properties to vacationers using the AirBnB platform and how to rent their properties to locals that are interested in a more long-term living arrangement. Since real estate is location driven, our proprietary data is also a good source for our clients to reference to help them decide which rental option is best for each of their properties. 

### Why You Should Become A Client
